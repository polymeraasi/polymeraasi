  <summary>📌 Description of skills </summary>
  <p>
    I have experience in software development using Python, C++, and LabVIEW, gained through my bachelor's degree minor in software engineering and internship. 
    During my master's, I transitioned to a minor in signal processing and machine learning, focusing on image processing (MATLAB), computer vision, and core machine 
    learning concepts, including classical models, reinforcement learning, and neural networks. I have also taken courses in databases (SQL) and data-intensive 
    programming (PySpark) to strengthen my knowledge in data engineering. In the future, I plan to pursue Azure certifications to deepen my understanding 
    of cloud-based data engineering solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also had the opportunity to study as an exchange student at ETH Zurich, where I took courses in AI, robotics, deep learning, and computer vision. 
    Additionally, I contributed to an AI-driven healthcare project using real-life patient data as part of a group collaboration.
